# CERES-EXPLORER
Space craft for a 4.1 year mission to Ceres - 13 crew

A hard science fiction engineering project. Function drives the design.

The future is difficult to predict even 10-20 years from now. The technology that makes this mission possible is the fusion propulsion system. So, if or when that happens, this ship can make the trip comfortable and safe following basic aerospace engineering principles.

Maybe you saw my Saturn Explorer, a failure due to insufficient radiation shielding. For 6-7 year mission, radiation exposure accumulates from galactic cosmic rays and other sources. Enough shielding would mass more than technology of 2080-2100 could realistically support. After many attempts, I concluded a trip to Saturn is not survivable without breakthrough technology.

Then lets go to Ceres. This less ambitious mission takes you there in 10 months safely.  The solution for radiation was surrounding the habitat with a 1 meter thick wall of water massing 1511 tonnes.

There are some innovations to note:

* Cargo on pallets can be placed on the lander for versatile transport.

* The habitat is an ovoid shape to efficiently use the space, reduce surface area and shift CG aft.

* The rotating ring inside the ovoid has air scoops to ventilate the ring.

* The ring's outer surface rotates on wheels fixed to the ovoid inner shell, no hub bearing.

* Waste heat from the reactor heats the propellant tanks and the ovoid water jacket, hydronic heating.

* Technically developed hydroponics systems for fresh air, water and fresh vegetables.

The mass budget leaves a generous 466 tonnes of propellant remaining (31%) after final Earth orbit.
