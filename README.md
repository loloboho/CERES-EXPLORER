# CERES-EXPLORER
Space craft for a 4.1 year mission to Ceres - 13 crew

A hard science fiction engineering project. Function drives the design.

The future is difficult to predict even 10-20 years from now. The technology that makes this mission possible is the fusion propulsion system. So, if or when that happens, this ship can make the trip comfortable and safe following basic aerospace engineering principles.

My Saturn Explorer was a failure due to insufficient radiation shielding. For 6-7 year mission, radiation exposure accumulates from galactic cosmic rays and other sources. Enough shielding would mass more than technology of 2080-2100 could realistically support. After many attempts, I concluded a trip to Saturn is not survivable without breakthrough technology.

Then lets go to Ceres. This less ambitious mission takes you there in 10 months safely.  The solution for radiation was surrounding the habitat with a 1 meter thick wall of water massing 1511 tonnes.
