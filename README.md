# CERES-EXPLORER
Space craft for a 4.5 year mission to Ceres and return - 13 crew

Maybe you saw my Saturn Explorer, a failure due to insuficient radiation shielding. Enough shielding would mass more than the 2080 tech could support realistically. Then lets go to Ceres. This less ambitious mission takes you there in 1-1/2 years in comfort. For 4.5 years, radiation accumulates from galactic cosmic rays (GCR) or solar particle events (SPE) and CME from the sun. The solution for radiation was surrounding the habitat with a 1 meter thick wall of water massing 2,043 tonnes. The habitat ovoid total mass is 2,412t, the aft units with engines et. al. mass is 979 tonnes. The habitat is almost 2-1/2 times the mass of all the engines. The CG of these two units is going to be more than 2/3 of way from aft unit to habitat. The mid unit is relatively light except for the propellant tanks. Placing the tanks near the CG insures stability throughout the mission as propellant is used.
These engineering choices have made the Cere Explorer a very stable, comfortable ship to explore Ceres.
